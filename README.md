## Purpose:

To create a web application where users can upload critical health information about 
their loved ones to get a preliminary idea about their heart health risk. This
application is not meant to be a substitute to meeting a health care professional,
but simply a method more elaborate than publically available quizzes to give people
an idea of their risk. 

## Metrics:

## Use instructions:

## To-do:

1. modularize and create more files with distinct purposes
2. improve model accuracy 
3. create ui so a user can input their info and see their prediction (add warning about this not being medical advice, and to consult a specialist)
4. create a backend / server client for other features/apis and storage of sensitive information (user input)
